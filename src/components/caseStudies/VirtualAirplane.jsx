          <p>After the 737 MAX crashes, Boeing made pilot training a pillar of its safety commitments. Virtual Airplane was developed as a training tool to simulate cockpit procedures on iPads‚Äîstandard issue in Boeing aircraft. The goal: help pilots build operational fluency before stepping into simulators.</p>
          <p>I led the redesign of the Lesson Panel‚Äîthe main interface for navigating lessons. The original version functioned like a checklist, but pilots don‚Äôt think in checklists. They jump between systems, reference procedures, and need flexibility based on what they‚Äôre struggling with in the moment.</p>
          <p>We observed training sessions, interviewed student pilots, and worked closely with instructors. Most of the time, pilots trained by pointing at static cockpit posters and flipping through manuals like the FCOM. The lesson interface needed to reflect this real-world multitasking, not flatten it.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">All Lights On</h3>
              <p>SMEs and customers said they couldn‚Äôt read the simulator. I proposed a feature to simulate cockpit floodlights. It required dev tradeoffs due to streaming constraints, but it was a small fix with big impact‚Äîinstantly improving legibility.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Focus Button</h3>
              <p>Users often got lost in the simulation‚Äôs 3D space. I introduced a refocus button to reorient them back to the original view. It meant creating global camera logic, but once released, it drastically improved navigation and task completion.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Active Pause</h3>
              <p>Instructors needed a way to pause the sim without freezing every feature. I designed an Active Pause system that paused progression but still allowed exploration‚Äîpaired with a discreet notification system in the Lesson Panel.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Lesson Panel Sizing</h3>
              <p>The original panel was too small and inconsistent across teams. After testing, I standardized it to half-screen height and created documentation that multiple teams adopted. It reduced confusion and scrolling friction for trainees.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Realism vs. Clarity</h3>
              <p>Some teams wanted the interface to look like a real cockpit. I advocated for aviation-aligned structure and vocabulary, not skeuomorphism‚Äîfavoring focus over clutter.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">FCOM Integration vs. Screen Space</h3>
              <p>Pilots needed the FCOM constantly, but it's dense. We built a split-view with adjustable width so pilots could see it beside the Lesson Panel‚Äîwithout needing a second screen.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Pilot Autonomy vs. Instructor Control</h3>
              <p>We implemented role-aware views: pilots got open navigation, while instructors could lock pacing and drive the lesson forward in real-time.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">‚úÖ Outcome</h2>
          <p>The Lesson Panel redesign launched in Release 5.2. Feedback from instructors and trainees was overwhelmingly positive. It became the foundation for multiple other interfaces across the Learner Solutions platform.</p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Reduced user confusion through standardization and clear focus tools</li>
            <li>Improved instructional flexibility via role-aware controls</li>
