## About This Portfolio

This portfolio is an ongoing project and creative sandbox. It brings together my work in UX design, product development, and front-end engineering. I began this project as a challenge to myself after being laid off from Boeing. It coalesced when I saw a job posting and they asked for a Senior Product Designer that could use Tailwind CSS. Over the last few months, I synthesized learning React, Tailwind, and other frameworks that I heard about. 

I'm proud that I built this from the ground up using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It's where I explore code-driven storytelling, interaction design, and semantic design systems.

I’m using this space to:

- Share my approach to UX, systems thinking, and front-end development
- Showcase case studies across product, research, and civic tech
- Experiment with animation, generative visuals, and custom theming
- Create a more intentional and accessible developer portfolio

## Case Studies

Each case study lives in its own modular component and follows a consistent narrative structure: framing the problem, showing the process, and reflecting on outcomes.

Current case studies will include:

- Boeing Virtual Airplane – Product design for aerospace training
    - CDU – (Computer Display Unit) A feature that acted like a product in itself. 
- Gay City – Queer-centered communications and responsive web design (Where I first experimented with CSS)
- Velocity Dance Center – Service design and community engagement
- Sno-Isle Libraries – Library card onboarding research

Each case study will include visual patterns, documentation, and reflection.

## Technical Stack

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + custom design tokens
- CSS Modules
- Dark mode with theme palette switching
- Routing via `react-router-dom`
- Scroll-triggered animations with IntersectionObserver
- Planned integrations: Framer Motion, GSAP, p5.js, Web Audio API

## File Structure Overview
